# looking-glass-client-script
A basic bash script to use Looking Glass and connect to VMs with Looking Glass setup.

## Requirements

Requires `looking-glass-client` to be installed in `/usr/bin/bash/looking-glass-client` (If you want to change the script to a different setup, go ahead.)

Requires Looking Glass to be previously setup inside your virtual machine.

If you have problems with mouse cursor & odd behaviour with cursors. Remove the "tablet" from the VM. This can be done inside of Virtual Machine Manager.
